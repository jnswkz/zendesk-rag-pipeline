However, in addition to <a href=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/40147900639891-OptiStick-Troubleshooting-Guide#Power\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">the other problems this causes</span></a>, powering an OptiStick via USB will cause significant problems with the Operational Schedule feature.</p><p>Think about it this way: your OptiStick is tasked with powering down and powering off your display, but it is relying on that display to pull power from. Once the display is off, how is the OptiStick supposed to turn it back on? There is no power reaching it. That’s why it needs its own dedicated power source (i.e. outlet) to use Operational Scheduling properly.</p><p>For this reason, if you want to make use of Operational Scheduling with an OptiStick, <em><strong>be sure to plug it into a dedicated outlet, not the USB port.</strong></em></p><hr><p><a name=\"DifferentTimes\"></a></p><h2 id=\"h_01KF15FKYTNPXB6SVVSJEFZT55\">Operational Schedule Works at Different Times from How It Was Set</h2><p>This is very common and almost always goes back to the device Time Zone. Your first troubleshooting step for this issue should be to set the time zone.</p><p>This can be done either with the device itself, or remotely (if the device is online). To update it remotely, edit the screen, then hit <strong>Advanced</strong>. You should see the below bar, click the <strong>Time Zone</strong> button:</p><p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48241081465107\" width=\"624\" height=\"68\"></p><p>This will open up the <strong>Update Time Zone </strong>screen:</p><p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48241081468307\" width=\"624\" height=\"364\"></p><p>Here, simply select the appropriate Time Zone for your device. This should match the Operational Schedule you’ve set to it. Now, they should be aligned.</p><hr><p><a name=\"TurnOff\"></a></p><h2 id=\"h_01KF15FKYXDVHN0VZDDD4MF9CJ\">Screen Turns Off, But Not Back On</h2><p>One of the main reasons for this is that the <a href=\"#ImproperlyPowered\">OptiStick is improperly powered</a>. However, another possible reason (regardless of the device being used) is that Operational Scheduling might not be supported on your individual TV, regardless of settings. This is a limitation of the device.</p><p>Assuming the OptiStick is plugged into a wall socket and this issue persists, here is what you can try:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id=\"e7c6e244c69c860fcea6e2873e2ad27de\">Replace the HDMI-CEC connection with RS232.

However, in addition to <a href=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/40147900639891-OptiStick-Troubleshooting-Guide#Power\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">the other problems this causes</span></a>, powering an OptiStick via USB will cause significant problems with the Operational Schedule feature.</p><p>Think about it this way: your OptiStick is tasked with powering down and powering off your display, but it is relying on that display to pull power from. Once the display is off, how is the OptiStick supposed to turn it back on? There is no power reaching it. That’s why it needs its own dedicated power source (i.e. outlet) to use Operational Scheduling properly.</p><p>For this reason, if you want to make use of Operational Scheduling with an OptiStick, <em><strong>be sure to plug it into a dedicated outlet, not the USB port.</strong></em></p><hr><p><a name=\"DifferentTimes\"></a></p><h2 id=\"h_01KF15FKYTNPXB6SVVSJEFZT55\">Operational Schedule Works at Different Times from How It Was Set</h2><p>This is very common and almost always goes back to the device Time Zone. Your first troubleshooting step for this issue should be to set the time zone.</p><p>This can be done either with the device itself, or remotely (if the device is online). To update it remotely, edit the screen, then hit <strong>Advanced</strong>. You should see the below bar, click the <strong>Time Zone</strong> button:</p><p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48241081465107\" width=\"624\" height=\"68\"></p><p>This will open up the <strong>Update Time Zone </strong>screen:</p><p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48241081468307\" width=\"624\" height=\"364\"></p><p>Here, simply select the appropriate Time Zone for your device. This should match the Operational Schedule you’ve set to it. Now, they should be aligned.</p><hr><p><a name=\"TurnOff\"></a></p><h2 id=\"h_01KF15FKYXDVHN0VZDDD4MF9CJ\">Screen Turns Off, But Not Back On</h2><p>One of the main reasons for this is that the <a href=\"#ImproperlyPowered\">OptiStick is improperly powered</a>. However, another possible reason (regardless of the device being used) is that Operational Scheduling might not be supported on your individual TV, regardless of settings. This is a limitation of the device.</p><p>Assuming the OptiStick is plugged into a wall socket and this issue persists, here is what you can try:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id=\"e7c6e244c69c860fcea6e2873e2ad27de\">Replace the HDMI-CEC connection with RS232.
